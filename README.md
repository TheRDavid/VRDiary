# VR Diary (Master Thesis Project)

This thesis project was a Virtual Reality Diary that provided users with a creative playground to arrange their memories and experiences in "memory room", with each room representing one day. Users could place images, videos, text- and voice notes as well as 3D models to decorate their rooms.

18 people used the VR diary for a total of 91 days.
